This is a bot that uses PHP and MYSQL to scan various RSS feeds and builds a database from these feeds of the latest articles. These articles are then each given a shareability rating based on the number of times the URL of the article has been tweeted and shared on Facebook using an older version of the twitter api (now outdated) and Facebook's Graph API (FQL). These numbers are plugged in to a modified  Bayesian average equation to determine it's "shareability rating."
